soma
====

The ``ocean/soma`` test group implements variants of the Simulating Ocean
Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) test case from
`Wolfram et al. (2015) <https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-14-0260.1>`_.  From that
paper:

    The SOMA configuration is designed to investigate equilibrium mesoscale
    activity in a setting similar to how ocean climate models are deployed. It
    simulates an eddying, midlatitude ocean basin with latitudes ranging
    from 21.5째 to 48.5째N and longitudes ranging from 16.5째W to 16.5째E. In
    contrast to previous idealized double-gyre studies...this basin is circular
    instead of rectangular and features more realistic curved coastlines with a
    150-km-wide, 100-m-deep continental shelf.

Appendix A of the paper describes the topography, initial condition and wind
forcing.

The implementation of ``soma`` in ``compass`` includes four test cases:
``default``, ``long``, ``surface_restoring``, and ``three_layer``
at 4 resolutions: ``4km``, ``8km``, ``16km`` and ``32km``, and a fifth test
case, ``particles``, that is only at ``32km`` resolution.  The test cases at all
resolutions include ``initial_state`` and ``forward`` steps, and the
``particles`` test case, which also includes particle dynamics, has an extra
``analysis`` step.  The ``initial_state`` begins with a predefined mesh,
culls out "land" cells, and defines the initial conditions for the model.
The ``forward`` step performs a short time integration of the model.  The
``analysis`` step compares the temperature and salinity at each particle with
an analytic solution defining the initial condition.

shared config options
---------------------

Both ``soma`` test cases share the following config options:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # config options for Simulating Ocean Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) testcases
    [soma]

    # Linear thermal expansion coefficient
    eos_linear_alpha = 0.25
    # Density difference between surface and bottom waters
    density_difference = 5.0
    # Surface temperature value used in initial condition
    surface_temperature = 20.0
    # Surface salinity value used in initial condition
    surface_salinity = 34.0
    # vertical salinity gradient (PSU/m)
    salinity_gradient = 0.0008
    # Depth over which majority of initial stratification is placed (m)
    thermocline_depth = 300
    # Fraction of stratification put into linear profile extending from surface to
    # bottom
    density_difference_linear = 0.05
    # Scale factor controlling width of continental slope. Typically around 0.1
    phi = 0.1
    # Depth of the continental shelf (m)
    shelf_depth = 100
    # Depth of the bottom of the ocean for the SOMA test case (m)
    bottom_depth = 2500

    # the density range and number of surfaces for particles
    min_particle_density = 1028.5
    max_particle_density = 1030.0
    surface_count = 11

The parameters can be altered to change the initial condition or the particle
distribution.

default
-------

``ocean/soma/<resolution>/default`` is the default version of the SOMA
test case from `Wolfram et al. (2015) <https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-14-0260.1>`_.
This test uses 60 unequally spaced layers and does not use surface restoring
or include particle dynamics.

   :align: center

The test case includes a very short (3 time step) test run and validation of
prognostic variables for regression testing.

long
----

Results in Wolfram et al. (2015) are shown from longer simulations, as provided
by the ``ocean/soma/<resolution>/long`` test cases. As in the ``default``
test cases, this test uses 60 unequally spaced layers and does not use surface
restoring or include particle dynamics. Unlike ``default``, this test case is
configured for a longer simulation (3 years) potentially appropriate for
scientific work.

particles
---------

Wolfram et al. (2015) is focused on diffusion as measured by particle
trajectories.  For now, most SOMA test cases do not include particles, but
we include one test case, ``ocean/soma/32km/particles``, with particles from
the Lagrangian, In situ, Global, High-Performance Particle Tracking (LIGHT)
framework for regression testing.  Otherwise, the ``particles`` test case is
identical to ``default``. Particle-relate variables are also included in
the test-case validation.

surface_restoring
-----------------

The ``ocean/soma/<resolution>/surface_restoring`` test cases are identical to
``default`` except that they include restoring of the surface temperature to
a prescribed field that varies linearly with latitude.

three_layer
-----------

The ``ocean/soma/<resolution>/three_layer`` test cases are identical to
``default`` except that they have only 3 vertical layers and do not include the
continental shelf in the simulation domain.
