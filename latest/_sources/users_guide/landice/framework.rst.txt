Land-ice Framework
==================


extrapolate
~~~~~~~~~~~

The landice framework module ``compass/landice/extrapolate.py`` provides a
function for extrapolating variables into undefined regions.  It is copied
from a similar script in MPAS-Tools.

mesh

The following config options should be defined for all ``mesh_gen`` test cases (although
not necessarily with the same values shown here, which are the defaults for the 1â€“10km
Humboldt mesh):

    # the MALI domain, set these to None.
