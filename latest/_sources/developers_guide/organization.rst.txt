Organization of Tests
=====================

Here, we describe how tests in ``compass`` are organized, both in the package
itself and in the work directories where they get set up and run.  At the base
level are MPAS Cores (:ref:`dev_landice` or :ref:`dev_ocean`).  Each MPAS core
has collection of test groups, which has a collection of test cases, each of
which contains a sequence of steps.

Directory structure
-------------------

In the ``compass`` package within a local clone of the compass repository,
MPAS cores, test groups, test cases and steps are laid out like shown in Fig 1.

Each MPAS core has its directory with the ``compass`` package directory. Among
other contents of the MPAS core's directory is a ``tests`` directory that
contains all of the test groups.  Each test group contains directories for
the test cases and typically also python modules that define the shared steps.
Any steps that are specific to a test case would have a module within that
test case's directory.


More details on each of these organizational concepts -- :ref:`dev_cores`,
:ref:`dev_test_groups`, :ref:`dev_test_cases`, and :ref:`dev_steps` -- are
provided below.

The organization of the work directory similar but not quite the same as in the
``compass`` package, as shown in Fig. 2.

   :align: right
   :figwidth: 50 %

   Figure 2: The organization of MPAS cores (green), test groups (blue), test
   cases (orange) and steps (red) in an example work directory.

At the top level are directories for the MPAS cores.  There is no ``tests``
subdirectory in this case -- the test groups are directly within the MPAS
core's directory.  The organization of test cases within a test group can
include many additional subdirectories that help sort different versions of
the test cases.  In the examples shown above, each test case is in a
subdirectory indicating the resolution of the mesh used in the test case.
Finally, steps are in subdirectories of each test case.  In some cases,
additional subdirectories are used to sort steps within a test case (e.g. if
the same step will be run at different mesh resolutions in a convergence test).

.. _dev_cores:

MPAS Cores
----------

Currently, there are two MPAS cores, ``landice``, which has test cases for
MALI, and ``ocean``, which encompasses all the test cases for MPAS-Ocean.

From a developer's perspective, an MPAS core is a package within ``compass``
that has four major pieces:

1. A class that descends from the :py:class:`compass.MpasCore` base class.
   The class is defined in ``__init__.py`` and its ``__init__()`` method
   calls the :py:meth:`compass.MpasCore.add_test_group()` method to add each
   test group to the MPAS core.

2. A ``tests`` package, which contains packages for each
   test group, each of which contains various packages and modules for
   test cases and their steps.

3. An ``<mpas_core>.cfg`` config file containing any default config options
   that are universal to all test groups of the MPAS core.

4. Additional "framework" packages and modules shared between test groups.

The core's framework is a mix of shared code and other files (config files,
namelists, streams files, etc.) that is expected to be used only by modules
and packages within the core, not by other cores or the main compass
:ref:`dev_framework`.

The constructor (``__init__()`` method) for a child class of
:py:class:`compass.MpasCore` simply calls the parent class' version
of the constructor with ``super().__init__()``, passing the name of the MPAS
core.  Then, it creates objects for each test group and adds them to itself, as
in this example from :py:class:`compass.ocean.Ocean`:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.mpas_core import MpasCore
    from compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel import BaroclinicChannel
    from compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean import GlobalOcean
    from compass.ocean.tests.ice_shelf_2d import IceShelf2d
    from compass.ocean.tests.ziso import Ziso


    class Ocean(MpasCore):
        """
        The collection of all test case for the MPAS-Ocean core
        """

        def __init__(self):
            """
            Construct the collection of MPAS-Ocean test cases
            """
            super().__init__(name='ocean')

            self.add_test_group(BaroclinicChannel(mpas_core=self))
            self.add_test_group(GlobalOcean(mpas_core=self))
            self.add_test_group(IceShelf2d(mpas_core=self))
            self.add_test_group(Ziso(mpas_core=self))

The object ``self`` is always passed to the constructor for each test group
so test groups are aware of which MPAS core they belong to.  This is necessary,
for example, in order to create the path for each test group, test case and
step in the work directory.

The config file for the MPAS core should, at the very least, define the
default value for the ``mpas_model`` path in the ``[paths]`` section.  This
path should point to the path within the appropriate E3SM submodule where the
standalone component can be built.  This is the path to the directory where the
MPAS component's executable will be built, not to the executable itself.

Typically, the config file will also define the paths to the model executable
and the default namelist and streams files for "forward mode" (and, for the
ocean core, "init mode").

The config file also contains the name of a subdirectory on the
`LCRC server <https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/>`_
for the dynamical core in the ``core_path`` option in the ``downloads``
section:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # This config file has default config options for the landice core

    # The paths section points compass to external paths
    [paths]

    # the relative or absolute path to the root of a branch where MALI has been
    # built
    mpas_model = MALI-Dev/components/mpas-albany-landice

    # The namelists section defines paths to example_compact namelists that will be used
    # to generate specific namelists. By default, these point to the forward and
    # init namelists in the default_inputs directory after a successful build of
    # the landice model.  Change these in a custom config file if you need a different
    # example_compact.
    [namelists]
    forward = ${paths:mpas_model}/default_inputs/namelist.landice

    # The streams section defines paths to example_compact streams files that will be used
    # to generate specific streams files. By default, these point to the forward and
    # init streams files in the default_inputs directory after a successful build of
    # the landice model. Change these in a custom config file if you need a different
    # example_compact.
    [streams]
    forward = ${paths:mpas_model}/default_inputs/streams.landice


    # The executables section defines paths to required executables. These
    # executables are provided for use by specific test cases.  Most tools that
    # compass needs should be in the conda environment, so this is only the path
    # to the MALI executable by default.
    [executables]
    model = ${paths:mpas_model}/landice_model


    # Options related to downloading files
    [download]

    # the path on the server for MALI
    core_path = mpas-albany-landice

.. _dev_test_groups:

Test Groups
-----------

Test groups are the next level of test-case organization below
:ref:`dev_cores`.  Typically, the test cases within a test group are
in some way conceptually linked, serving a similar purpose or being variants on
one another. Often, they have a common topography and initial condition,
perhaps with different mesh resolutions, parameters, or both.  It is common for
a test group to include "framework" modules that are shared between its test
cases and steps (but not with other test groups).  Each MPAS core will
typically include a mix of "idealized" test groups (e.g.
:ref:`dev_ocean_baroclinic_channel` or :ref:`dev_landice_dome`) and "realistic"
domains (e.g. :ref:`dev_landice_greenland` and :ref:`dev_ocean_global_ocean`).

Each test group is a python package within the core's ``tests`` package.
While it is not required, a test group will typically include a config file,
named ``<test_group>.cfg``, with a set of default config options that are
the starting point for all its test cases.  As an example, here is the config
file for the ``dome`` test group in the ``landice`` core:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # config options for dome test cases
    [dome]

    # sizes (in cells) for the 2000m uniform mesh
    nx = 30
    ny = 34

    # resolution (in m) for the 2000m uniform mesh
    dc = 2000.0

    # number of levels in the mesh
    levels = 10

    # the dome type ('halfar' or 'cism')
    dome_type = halfar

    # Whether to center the dome in the center of the cell that is closest to the
    # center of the domain
    put_origin_on_a_cell = True

    # whether to add a small shelf to the test
    shelf = False

    # whether to add hydrology to the initial condition
    hydro = False

    # config options related to visualization for dome test cases
    [dome_viz]

    # which time index to visualize
    time_slice = 0

    # whether to save image files
    save_images = True

    # whether to hide figures (typically when save_images = True)
    hide_figs = True

Some test group options will provide defaults for config options that are
shared across the core (as is the case for the ``[vertical_grid]`` config
section in the ocean core).  But most config options for a test group will
typically go into a section with the same name as the test group, as in the
example above.  Config options that are specific to a particular step might
go into a section with another name, like the ``[dome_viz]`` section above.

The ``__init__.py`` file for the test group must define a class for the
test group that descends from :py:class:`compass.TestGroup`. The constructor
of that class (``__init__()``) first calls the base class' constructor with the
parent :py:class:`compass.MpasCore` object and the name of the test group.
Then, it constructs objects for each test case in the group and adds them to
itself by calling :py:meth:`compass.TestGroup.add_test_case()`.  Each test case
gets passed the ``self`` object as its test group, allowing the test case to
determine both with MPAS core and which test group it belongs to. As an
example, the :py:class:`compass.landice.tests.dome.Dome` class looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.testgroup import TestGroup
    from compass.landice.tests.dome.smoke_test import SmokeTest
    from compass.landice.tests.dome.decomposition_test import DecompositionTest
    from compass.landice.tests.dome.restart_test import RestartTest


    class Dome(TestGroup):
        """
        A test group for dome test cases
        """
        def __init__(self, mpas_core):
            """
            mpas_core : compass.landice.Landice
                the MPAS core that this test group belongs to
            """
            super().__init__(mpas_core=mpas_core, name='dome')

            for mesh_type in ['2000m', 'variable_resolution']:
                self.add_test_case(
                    SmokeTest(test_group=self, mesh_type=mesh_type))
                self.add_test_case(
                    DecompositionTest(test_group=self, mesh_type=mesh_type))
                self.add_test_case(
                    RestartTest(test_group=self, mesh_type=mesh_type))

As in this example, it may be useful for a test group to make several
versions of a test case by passing different parameters.  In the example, we
create versions of ``SmokeTest``, ``DecompositionTest`` and ``RestartTest``
with each of two mesh types (``2000m`` and ``variable_resolution``).  We will
explore this further when we talk about :ref:`dev_test_cases` and
:ref:`dev_steps` below.

It is also common for a test group to define takes care of setting any
additional config options that apply across all test cases but are too
complicated to simply add to the ``<test_group.cfg>`` file.

An example of a shared ``configure()`` function is
:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.configure()`:

.. code-block:: python


    def configure(resolution, config):
        """
        Modify the configuration options for one of the baroclinic test cases

        Parameters
        ----------
        resolution : str
            The resolution of the test case

        config : configparser.ConfigParser
            Configuration options for this test case
        """
        res_params = {'10km': {'nx': 16,
                               'ny': 50,
                               'dc': 10e3},
                      '4km': {'nx': 40,
                              'ny': 126,
                              'dc': 4e3},
                      '1km': {'nx': 160,
                              'ny': 500,
                              'dc': 1e3}}

        if resolution not in res_params:
            raise ValueError('Unsupported resolution {}. Supported values are: '
                             '{}'.format(resolution, list(res_params)))
        res_params = res_params[resolution]
        for param in res_params:
            config.set('baroclinic_channel', param, '{}'.format(res_params[param]))

In the ``baroclinic_channel`` test group, 3 resolutions are supported:
``1km``, ``4km`` and ``10km``.  Here, we use a dictionary to define parameters
(the size of the mesh) associated with each resolution and then to set config
options with those parameters.  This approach is appropriate if we want a user
to be able to modify these config options before running the test case (in this
case, if they would like to run on a mesh of a different size or resolution).
If these parameters should be held fixed, they should not be added to the
``config`` object but rather as attributes to the test case's and/or step's
class, as we will discuss below.

As with MPAS cores and the main ``compass`` package, test groups can also have
a shared "framework" of packages, modules, config files, namelists, and streams
files that is shared among test cases and steps.

.. _dev_test_cases:

Test cases
----------

In many ways, test cases are compass's fundamental building blocks, since a
user can't set up an individual step of test case (though they can run the
steps one at a time).

A test case can be a module but is usually a python package so it can
incorporate modules for its steps and/or config files, namelists, and streams
files.  The test case must include a class that descends from
:py:class:`compass.TestCase`.  In addition to a constructor (``__init__()``),
the class will often override the ``configure()`` and ``validate()`` methods of
the base class, as described below.

The ``run()`` method in :py:class:`compass.TestCase` is deprecated; behaviors
at runtime can instead be handled by individual steps by overriding the
:py:meth:`compass.Step.constrain_resources()` and
:py:meth:`compass.Step.runtime_setup()` methods.  Details about these methods
are described further in :ref:`dev_steps`.

.. _dev_test_case_class:

TestCase attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The base class :py:class:`compass.TestCase` has a large number of attributes
that are useful at different stages (init, configuration and run) of the test
case.

Some attributes are available after calling the base class' constructor
``super().__init__()``.  These include:

``self.name``
    the name of the test case

``self.test_group``
    The test group the test case belongs to

``self.mpas_core``
    The MPAS core the test group belongs to

``self.subdir``
    the subdirectory for the test case

``self.path``
    the path within the base work directory of the test case, made up of
    ``mpas_core``, ``test_group``, and the test case's ``subdir``

Other attributes become useful only after steps have been added to the test
case:

``self.steps``
    A dictionary of steps in the test case with step names as keys

``self.steps_to_run``
    A list of the steps to run when :py:func:`compass.run.serial.run_tests()`
    gets called.  This list includes all steps by default but can be replaced
    with a list of only those tests that should run by default if some steps
    are optional and should be run manually by the user.

Another set of attributes is not useful until ``configure()`` is called by the
``compass`` framework:

``self.config``
    Configuration options for this test case, a combination of the defaults
    for the machine, core and configuration

``self.config_filename``
    The local name of the config file that ``config`` has been written to
    during setup and read from during run

``self.work_dir``
    The test case's work directory, defined during setup as the combination
    of ``base_work_dir`` and ``path``

``self.base_work_dir``
    The base work directory

These can be used to make further alterations to the config options or to add
symlinks files in the test case's work directory.

Finally, one attribute is available only when the
:py:func:`compass.run.serial.run_tests()` function gets called by the
framework:

``self.logger``
    A logger for output from the test case.  This gets accessed by other
    methods and functions that use the logger to write their output to the log
    file.

You can add other attributes to the child class that keeps track of information
that the test case or its steps will need.  As an example,
:py:class:`compass.landice.tests.dome.smoke_test.SmokeTest` keeps track of the
mesh type and the velocity solver an attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    class SmokeTest(TestCase):
        """
        The default test case for the dome test group simply creates the mesh and
        initial condition, then performs a short forward run on 4 cores.

        Attributes

        mesh_type : str
            The resolution or type of mesh of the test case

        def __init__(self, test_group, velo_solver, mesh_type):
            """

            name = 'smoke_test'
            self.mesh_type = mesh_type
            self.velo_solver = velo_solver
            subdir = '{}/{}_{}'.format(mesh_type, velo_solver.lower(), name)
            super().__init__(test_group=test_group, name=name,
                             subdir=subdir)

            self.add_step(
                SetupMesh(test_case=self, mesh_type=mesh_type))

            step = RunModel(test_case=self, ntasks=4, openmp_threads=1,
                            name='run_step', velo_solver=velo_solver,
                            mesh_type=mesh_type)
            if velo_solver == 'sia':
                step.add_namelist_options(
                    {'config_run_duration': "'0200-00-00_00:00:00'"})
            self.add_step(step)

            step = Visualize(test_case=self, mesh_type=mesh_type)
            self.add_step(step, run_by_default=False)

.. _dev_test_case_init:

constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``__init__()`` method must first call the base constructor
``super().__init__()``, passing the name of the test case, the test group it
will belong to, and the subdirectory (if different from the name of the test
case).  Then, it should create an object for each step and add them to itself
using call :py:func:`compass.TestCase.add_step()`.

It is important that ``__init__()`` doesn't perform any time-consuming
calculations, download files, or otherwise use significant resources because
objects get constructed (and all constructors get called) quite often for every
single test case and step in ``compass``: when test cases are listed, set up,
or cleaned up, and also when test suites are set up or cleaned up.

However, it is fine to call the following methods on a step during init because
these methods only keep track of a "recipe" for downloading files or
constructing namelist and streams files, they don't actually do the work
associated with these steps until the point where the step is being set up in

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_output_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()`

As an example, here is the constructor from
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.rpe_test.RpeTest`:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.testcase import TestCase
    from compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.initial_state import InitialState

                    'compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.rpe_test',
                    'namelist.forward')
                step.add_streams_file(
                    'compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.rpe_test',
                    'streams.forward')
                self.add_step(step)

            self.add_step(
                Analysis(test_case=self, resolution=resolution, nus=nus))

We have deliberately chosen a fairly complex example to demonstrate how to make
full use of :ref:`dev_code_sharing` in a test case.

The test case imports the classes for its steps --
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.initial_state.InitialState`,
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.forward.Forward`, and
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.rpe_test.analysis.Analysis`
-- so it can create objects for each and add them to itself with
:py:func:`compass.TestCase.add_step()`.  After this, the :py:class:`dict` of
steps will be available in ``self.steps``.

By default, the test case will go into a subdirectory with the same name as the
test case (``rpe_test`` in this case).  However, ``compass`` is flexible
about the subdirectory structure and the names of the subdirectories.  This
flexibility was an important requirement in moving away from
:ref:`legacy_compass`.  Each test case and step must end up in a unique
directory, so it may be important that the name and subdirectory of each test
case or step depends in some way on the arguments passed the constructor.  In
the example above, the resolution is an argument to the constructor, which is
then saved as an attribute (``self.resolution``) and also used to define a
unique subdirectory each resolution: ``1km/rpe_test``, ``4km/rpe_test`` and
``10km/rpe_test``.

The same ``Forward`` step is included in the test case 5 times with a different
viscosity parameter ``nu`` for each.  The value of
``nu`` is passed to the step's constructor, along with
the unique ``name``, ``subdir``, and several other parameters:
``resolution``, ``ntasks``, and ``min_tasks``. In this example, the steps are
given rather clumsy names -- ``rpe_test_1_nu_1``, ``rpe_test_2_nu_5``, etc. --
but these could be any unique names.

.. _dev_test_case_configure:

configure()
^^^^^^^^^^^

The :py:meth:`compass.TestCase.configure()` method can be overridden by a
child class to set config options or build them up from defaults stored in
config files within the test case or its test group. The ``self.config``
attribute that is modified in this function will be written to a config file
for the test case (see :ref:`config_files`).

If you override this method in a test case, you should assume that the
``<test_case.name>.cfg`` file in its package has already been added to the
config options prior to calling ``configure()``.  This happens automatically
during test-case setup.

Since many test groups need similar behavior in the ``configure()`` method for
each test case, it is common to have a shared function (sometimes also called
``configure()``) in the test group, as we discussed in :ref:`dev_test_groups`.

:py:meth:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.rpe_test.RpeTest.configure()`
simply calls the shared function in its test group,
:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.configure()`:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.ocean.tests import baroclinic_channel


    def configure(self):
        """
        Modify the configuration options for this test case.
        """
        baroclinic_channel.configure(self.resolution, self.config)

:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.configure()` was already
shown in :ref:`dev_test_groups` above.  It sets parameters for the number of
cells in the mesh in the x and y directions and the resolution of those cells.

The ``configure()`` method can also be used to perform other operations at the
test-case level when a test case is being set up. An example of this would be
creating a symlink to a README file that is shared across the whole test case,
as in :py:meth:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.files_for_e3sm.FilesForE3SM.configure()`:


.. code-block:: python

    from compass.io import symlink, package_path


    def configure(self):
        """
        Modify the configuration options for this test case
        """
        self.init.configure(config=self.config)
        package = 'compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.files_for_e3sm'
        with package_path(package, 'README') as target:
            symlink(str(target), '{}/README'.format(self.work_dir))

The ``configure()`` method is not the right place for adding or modifying steps
that belong to a test case.  Steps should be added during init and altered only
in their own ``setup()`` or ``runtime_setup()`` methods.

Test cases that don't need to change config options don't need to override
``configure()`` at all.

.. _dev_test_case_run:

run()
^^^^^

The functionality of :py:meth:`compass.TestCase.run()` has been moved to the
:py:func:`compass.run.serial.run_tests()` function.  The ``run`` method is now
deprecated and should not be used to modify runtime processes;
:py:meth:`compass.Step.constrain_resources()` and
:py:meth:`compass.Step.runtime_setup()` should be used instead.  These methods
are further explained in :ref:`dev_steps`.

.. _dev_test_case_validate:

validate()
^^^^^^^^^^

The base class's :py:meth:`compass.TestCase.validate()` can be overridden to
perform :ref:`dev_validation` of variables in output files from a step and/or
timers from the MPAS model.

In  :py:meth:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.init.Init.validate()`, we see
examples of validation of variables from output files:

.. code-block:: python

    def validate(self):
        """
        Test cases can override this method to perform validation of variables
        and timers
        """
        steps = self.steps_to_run

        variables = ['temperature', 'salinity', 'layerThickness']
        compare_variables(test_case=self, variables=variables,
                          filename1='initial_state/initial_state.nc')

        if self.with_bgc:
            variables = [
                'temperature', 'salinity', 'layerThickness', 'PO4', 'NO3',
                'SiO3', 'NH4', 'Fe', 'O2', 'DIC', 'DIC_ALT_CO2', 'ALK',
                'DOC', 'DON', 'DOFe', 'DOP', 'DOPr', 'DONr', 'zooC',
                'spChl', 'spC', 'spFe', 'spCaCO3', 'diatChl', 'diatC',
                'diatFe', 'diatSi', 'diazChl', 'diazC', 'diazFe',
                'phaeoChl', 'phaeoC', 'phaeoFe', 'DMS', 'DMSP', 'PROT',
                'POLY', 'LIP']
            compare_variables(test_case=self, variables=variables,
                              filename1='initial_state/initial_state.nc')

        if self.mesh.with_ice_shelf_cavities:
            variables = ['ssh', 'landIcePressure']
            compare_variables(test_case=self, variables=variables,
                              filename1='ssh_adjustment/adjusted_init.nc')

If you leave the default keyword argument ``skip_if_step_not_run=True``,
comparison will be skipped (logging a message) if one or more of the steps
involved in the comparison was not run.

.. _dev_steps:

Steps
-----

Steps are the smallest units of work that can be executed on their own in
``compass``.  All test cases are made up of 1 or more steps, and all steps
are set up into subdirectories inside of the work directory for the test case.
Typically, a user will run all steps in a test case but certain test cases may
prefer to have steps that are not run by default (e.g. a long forward
simulation or optional visualization) but which are available for a user to
manually alter and then run on their own.

A step is defined by a class that descends from :py:class:`compass.Step`.
The child class must override the constructor and the
:py:meth:`compass.Step.run()` method, and will sometimes also wish to override
the :py:meth:`compass.Step.setup()` method, described below.


.. _dev_step_attributes:

Step attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As was the case for test cases, the base class :py:class:`compass.Step` has a
large number of attributes that are useful at different stages (init, setup and
run) of the step.

Some attributes are available after calling the base class' constructor
``super().__init__()``.  These include:

``self.name``
    the name of the test case

``self.test_case``
    The test case this step belongs to

``self.test_group``
    The test group the test case belongs to

``self.mpas_core``
    The MPAS core the test group belongs to

``self.subdir``
    the subdirectory for the step

``self.path``
    the path within the base work directory of the step, made up of
    ``mpas_core``, ``test_group``, the test case's ``subdir`` and the
    step's ``subdir``

``self.ntasks``
    the number of parallel (MPI) tasks the step would ideally use.  Too few
    cores are available on the system to run ``ntasks * cpus_per_task``, the
    step will run on all available cores as long as this is not below
    ``min_tasks * min_cpus_per_task``

``self.min_tasks``
    the number of MPI tasks the step requires.  If the system fewer than
    ``min_tasks * min_cpus_per_task`` cores, the step will fail

``self.cpus_per_task``
    The number of CPUs that each task runs with, or the total number of CPUs
    the step would ideally run with if python threading or multiprocessing is
    being used, in which case ``ntasks = 1``

``self.min_cpus_per_task``
    The minimum number of CPUs that each task runs with, or the minimum total
    number of CPUs required for the step if python threading or multiprocessing
    is being used, in which case ``ntasks = 1``.  If ``ntasks > 1``,
    ``min_cpus_per_task`` much be the same as ``cpus_per_task``.

``self.openmp_threads``
    the number of OpenMP threads the step will use

``self.cached``
    Whether to get all of the outputs for the step from the database of
    cached outputs for the MPAS core that this step belongs to

``self.run_as_subprocess``
    Whether to run this step as a subprocess, rather than just running
    it directly from the test case.  It is useful to run a step as a
    subprocess if there is not a good way to redirect output to a log
    file (e.g. if the step calls external code that, in turn, calls
    additional subprocesses).

    The default behavior when python code calls one of the ``subprocess``
    functions is that the output goes to ``stdout``/``stderr``
    (i.e. the terminal).  When python code outside of compass
    (e.g. ``jigsawpy``) calls a ``subprocess`` function (e.g. to call
    JIGSAW), that output goes to the terminal rather than a log file.
    For most output to ``stdout``/``stderr`` like ``print()`` statements,
    ``check_call()`` in MPAS-Tools employs a "trick" to redirect that
    output to a log file instead.  But that doesn't work with
    ``subprocess`` calls.  They continue to go to the terminal.  However,
    if we call a given compass step as a subprocess while redirecting its
    output to a log file, we can prevent unwanted output from ending up
    in the terminal (the "outer" subprocess call gets redirected to a log
    file even when the inner one does not).

Another set of attributes is not useful until ``setup()`` is called by the
``compass`` framework:

``self.config``
    Configuration options for this test case, a combination of the defaults
    for the machine, core and configuration

``self.config_filename``
    The local name of the config file that ``config`` has been written to
    during setup and read from during run

``self.work_dir``
    The step's work directory, defined during setup as the combination
    of ``base_work_dir`` and ``path``

``self.base_work_dir``
    The base work directory

These can be used to add additional input, output, namelist or streams files
based on config options that were not available during init, or which rely on
knowing the work directory.

Finally, a few attributes are available only when ``run()`` gets called by the
framework:

``self.inputs``
    a list of absolute paths of input files produced as part of setting up the
    step.  These input files must all exist at run time or the step will raise
    an exception

``self.outputs``
    a list of absolute paths of output files produced by this step and
    available as inputs to other test cases and steps.  These files must
    exist after the test has run or an exception will be raised

``self.logger``
    A logger for output from the step.  This gets passed on to other
    methods and functions that use the logger to write their output to the log
    file.

``self.log_filename``
    The name of a log file where output/errors from the step are being logged,
    or ``None`` if output is to stdout/stderr

The inputs and outputs should not be altered but they may be used to get file
names to read or write.

You can add other attributes to the child class that keeps track of information
that the step will need.

As an example,
:py:class:`compass.landice.tests.dome.setup_mesh.SetupMesh` keeps track of the
mesh type as an attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.model import make_graph_file
    from compass.step import Step


    class SetupMesh(Step):
        """
        A step for creating a mesh and initial condition for dome test cases

        Attributes
        ----------
        mesh_type : str
            The resolution or mesh type of the test case
        """
        def __init__(self, test_case, mesh_type):
            """
            Update the dictionary of step properties

            Parameters
            ----------
            test_case : compass.TestCase
                The test case this step belongs to

            mesh_type : str
                The resolution or mesh type of the test case
            """
            super().__init__(test_case=test_case, name='setup_mesh')
            self.mesh_type = mesh_type

            if mesh_type == 'variable_resolution':
                # download and link the mesh
                # the empty database is a trick for downloading to the root of
                # the local MALI file cache
                self.add_input_file(filename='mpas_grid.nc',
                                    target='dome_varres_grid.nc', database='')

            self.add_output_file(filename='graph.info')
            self.add_output_file(filename='landice_grid.nc')

.. _dev_step_init:

constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^

The step's constructor (``__init__()`` method) should call the base case's
constructor with ``super().__init__()``, passing the name of the step, the
test case it belongs to, and possibly several optional arguments: the
subdirectory for the step (if not the same as the name), number of MPI tasks,
the minimum number of MPI tasks, the number of CPUs per task, the minimum
number of CPUs per task, the number of OpenMP threads, and (currently as
placeholders) the amount of memory the step is allowed to use.

Then, the step can add :ref:`dev_step_inputs_outputs` as well as
:ref:`dev_step_namelists_and_streams`, as described below.

As with the test case's :ref:`dev_test_case_init`, it is important that the
step's constructor doesn't perform any time-consuming calculations, download
files, or otherwise use significant resources because this function is called
quite often for every single test case and step: when test cases are listed,
set up, or cleaned up, and also when test suites are set up or cleaned up.
However, it is okay to add input, output, streams and namelist files to
the step by calling any of the following methods:

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_output_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()`

Each of these functions just caches information about the the inputs, outputs,
namelists or streams files to be read later if the test case in question gets
set up, so each takes a negligible amount of time.

The following is from
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.forward.Forward()`:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.step import Step


    class Forward(Step):
        """

        channel test cases.

                are available on the system, the step will run on all available
                tasks as long as this is not below ``min_tasks``

            min_tasks : int, optional
                the number of tasks the step requires.  If the system has fewer
                than this number of tasks, the step will fail

            openmp_threads : int, optional
                the number of OpenMP threads the step will use

            """
            self.resolution = resolution

            super().__init__(test_case=test_case, name=name, subdir=subdir,
                             ntasks=ntasks, min_tasks=min_tasks,

            self.add_model_as_input()

            self.add_output_file(filename='output.nc')


Several parameters are passed into the constructor (with defaults if they
are not included) and then passed on to the base class' constructor: ``name``,
``subdir``, ``ntasks``, ``min_tasks``, ``cpus_per_task``,
``min_cpus_per_task``, and ``openmp_threads``.

Then, two files with modifications to the namelist options are added (for
later processing), and an additional config option is set manually via
a python dictionary of namelist options.

Then, a file with modifications to the default streams is also added (again,
for later processing).

Finally, two input and one output file are added.

.. _dev_step_constrain_resources:

constrain_resources()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``constrain_resources()`` method is used to update the ``ntasks``,
``min_tasks``, ``cpus_per_task``, and ``min_cpus_per_task`` attributes prior to
running the step, in case the user has modified these in the config options.
These performance-related attributes affect how the step runs and must be set
prior to runtime, whereas other options can be set within ``runtime_setup()``.

``constrain_resources()`` is called within
:py:func:`compass.run.serial.run_tests()`, but can be overridden if desired.
The typical reason to override this function would be to get config options for
``ntasks``, ``min_tasks``, ``cpus_per_task``, etc. and set the corresponding
attributes.  Another reason might be to set these attributes using an algorithm
(e.g. based on the number of cells in the mesh used in the step.)
When overriding ``constrain_resources``, it is important to also call the base
class' version of the method with ``super().constrain_resources()``.

.. _dev_step_setup:

setup()
^^^^^^^

The ``setup()`` method is called when a user is setting up the step either
as part of a call to :ref:`dev_compass_setup` or :ref:`dev_compass_suite`.
As in :ref:`dev_step_init`, you can add input, output, streams and namelist
files to the step by calling any of the following methods:

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_output_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`

* :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()`

If you are running the MPAS model, you should call
:py:func:`compass.Step.add_model_as_input()` to create a symlink to the
MPAS model's executable.  This can be done in the constructor or the
``setup()`` method.

Set up should not do any major computations or any time-consuming operations
other than downloading files.  Time-consuming work should be saved for
``run()`` whenever possible.

As an example, here is
:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.mesh.mesh.MeshStep.setup()`:

.. code-block:: python

    def setup(self):
        """
        Set up the test case in the work directory, including downloading any
        dependencies.
        """
        # get the these properties from the config options
        config = self.config
        self.cpus_per_task = config.getint('global_ocean',
                                           'mesh_cpus_per_task')
        self.min_cpus_per_task = config.getint('global_ocean',
                                               'mesh_min_cpus_per_task')

Some parts of the mesh computation (creating masks for culling) are done using
python multiprocessing, so the ``cpus_per_task`` and ``min_cpus_per_task``
attributes are set to appropriate values based on config options.

.. _dev_step_runtime_setup:

runtime_setup()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``runtime_setup()`` method is used to modify any behaviors of the step at
runtime, in the way that :py:meth:`compass.TestCase.run()` was previously used.
This includes things like partitioning an MPAS mesh across processors and
computing a times step based on config options that might have been modified
by the user.  It must not include modifying the ``ntasks``, ``min_tasks``,
``cpus_per_task``, ``min_cpus_per_task`` or ``openmp_threads`` attributes.

run()
^^^^^

Okay, we're ready to define how the step will run!

The contents of ``run()`` can vary quite a lot between steps.

In the ``baroclinic_channel`` test group, the ``run()`` function for
the ``initial_state`` step,
:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.initial_state.InitialState.run()`,
is quite involved:

            layerThickness = xarray.DataArray(data=interfaces[1:] - interfaces[0:-1],

            normalVelocity = xarray.zeros_like(ds.xEdge)
            normalVelocity, _ = xarray.broadcast(normalVelocity, ds.refBottomDepth)

            ds['temperature'] = temperature
            ds['salinity'] = salinity * xarray.ones_like(temperature)
            ds['normalVelocity'] = normalVelocity
            ds['layerThickness'] = layerThickness

            ds['fCell'] = coriolis_parameter * xarray.ones_like(xCell)
            ds['fEdge'] = coriolis_parameter * xarray.ones_like(ds.xEdge)
            ds['fVertex'] = coriolis_parameter * xarray.ones_like(ds.xVertex)

            write_netcdf(ds, 'ocean.nc')

Without going into all the details of this method, it creates a mesh that
is periodic in x (but not y), then adds a vertical grid and an initial
condition to an :py:class:`xarray.Dataset`, which is then written out to
the file ``ocean.nc``.

In the example step we've been using,
:py:func:`compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel.forward.Forward.run()` looks
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.model import run_model


    def run(self):
        """
        Run this step of the test case
        """
        run_model(self)

the :py:func:`compass.model.run_model()` function takes care of updating the
namelist options for the test case to make sure the PIO tasks and stride are
consistent with the requested number of MPI tasks, creates a graph partition
for the requested number of tasks, and runs the model.

To get a feel for different types of ``run()`` methods, it may be best to
explore different steps.

.. _dev_step_inputs_outputs:

inputs and outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, steps run in sequence in the order they are added to the test case
(or in the order they appear in the test case's ``steps_to_run`` attribute.
There are plans to allow test cases and their steps to run in parallel in the
future. For this reason, we require that each step defines a list of the
absolute paths to all input files that could come from other steps (possibly in
other test cases) and all outputs from the step that might be used by other
steps (again, possibly in other test cases).  There is no harm in including
inputs to the step that do not come from other steps (e.g. files that will be
downloaded when the test case gets set up) as long as they are sure to exist
before the step runs.  Likewise, there is no harm in including outputs from the
step that aren't used by any other steps in any test cases as long as the step
will be sure to generate them.

The inputs and outputs need to be defined during init of either the step or
the test case, or in the step's ``setup()`` method because they are needed
before :ref:`dev_step_run` is called (to determine which steps depend on which
other steps).  Inputs are added with :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`
and outputs with :py:func:`compass.Step.add_output_file()`.  Inputs may be
symbolic links to files in ``compass``, from the various databases on the
`LCRC server <https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/>`_,
downloaded from another source, or from another step.

Because the inputs and outputs need to be defined before the step runs, there
can be some cases to avoid.  The name of an output file should not depend on a
config option.  Otherwise, if the user changes the config option, the file
actually created may have a different name than expected, in which case the
step will fail.  This would be true even if a subsequent step would have been
able to read in the same config option and modify the name of the expected
input file.

Along the same lines, an input or output file name should not depend on data
from an input file that does not exist during :ref:`dev_step_setup`.  Since the
file does not exist, there is no way to read the file with the dependency
within :ref:`dev_step_setup` and determine the resulting input or output file
name.

Both of these issues have arisen for the
:ref:`dev_ocean_global_ocean_files_for_e3sm` from the
:ref:`dev_ocean_global_ocean` test group.  Output files are named using the
"short name" of the mesh in E3SM, which depends both on config options and on
the number of vertical levels, which is read in from a mesh file created in a
previous step.  For now, the outputs of this step are not used by any other
steps so it is safe to simply omit them, but this could become problematic in
the future if new steps are added that depend on
:ref:`dev_ocean_global_ocean_files_for_e3sm`.

:py:class:`compass.Step` includes several methods for adding input, output,
namelist and streams files:

.. _dev_step_input:

Input files
~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, a step will add input files with
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()` during init or in its ``setup()``
method.  It is also possible to add inputs in the test case's
:ref:`dev_test_case_init`.

It is possible to simply supply the path to an input file as ``filename``
without any other arguments to :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`.  In
this case, the file name is either an absolute path or a relative path with
respect to the step's work directory:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, test_case):
        ...
        self.add_input_file(filename='../setup_mesh/landice_grid.nc')

This is not typically how ``add_input_file()`` is used because input files are
usually not directly in the step's work directory.

.. _dev_step_input_symlinks:

Symlinks to input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common type of input file is the output from another step. Rather than
just giving the file name directly, as in the example above, the preference is
to place a symbolic link in the work directory.  This makes it much easier to
see if the file is missing (because symlink will show up as broken) and allows
you to refer to a short, local name for the file rather than its full path:

.. code-block:: python

    import xarray

    def __init__(self, test_case):
        ...
        self.add_input_file(filename='landice_grid.nc',
                            target='../setup_mesh/landice_grid.nc')

    ...

    def run(step, test_suite, config, logger):
       ...
       with xarray.open_dataset('landice_grid.nc') as ds:
           ...

A symlink is not actually created when :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()`
is called.  This will not happen until the step gets set up, after calling its
:ref:`dev_step_setup` method.

Sometimes you want to create a symlink to an input file in the work directory,
but the relative path between the target and the step's work directory
isn't very convenient to determine.  This may be because the name of the
subdirectory for this step or the target's step (or both) depends on
parameters.  For such cases, there is a ``work_dir_target`` argument that
allows you to give the path with respect to the base work directory (which is
not yet known at init). Here is an example taken from
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.forward.ForwardStep`:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, test_case, mesh, init, ...):
        mesh_path = mesh.mesh_step.path

        if mesh.with_ice_shelf_cavities:
            initial_state_target = '{}/ssh_adjustment/adjusted_init.nc'.format(
                init.path)
        else:
            initial_state_target = '{}/initial_state/initial_state.nc'.format(
                init.path)
        self.add_input_file(filename='init.nc',
                            work_dir_target=initial_state_target)
        self.add_input_file(
            filename='forcing_data.nc',
            work_dir_target='{}/initial_state/init_mode_forcing_data.nc'
                            ''.format(init.path))
        self.add_input_file(
            filename='graph.info',
            work_dir_target='{}/culled_graph.info'.format(mesh_path))



.. _dev_step_input_compass:

Symlink to input files from compass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another common need is to symlink a data file from within the test group or
test case:

.. code-block:: python

    from compass.io import add_input_file


    def __init__(self, test_case):
        ...
        self.add_input_file(
            filename='enthA_analy_result.mat',
            package='compass.landice.tests.enthalpy_benchmark.A')

Here, we supply the name of the package that the file is in.  The ``compass``
framework will take care of figuring out where the package is located.

.. _dev_step_input_download:

Downloading and symlinking input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another type of input file is one that is downloaded and stored locally.
Typically, to save ourselves the time of downloading large files and to reduce
potential problems on systems with firewalls, we cache the downloaded files in
a location where they can be shared between users and reused over time.  These
"databases" are subdirectories of the core's database root on the
`LCRC server <https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/>`_.

To add an input file from a database, call
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_input_file()` with the ``database`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_input_file(
        filename='topography.nc',
        target='BedMachineAntarctica_v2_and_GEBCO_2022_0.05_degree_20220729.nc',
        database='bathymetry_database')

In this example from
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.init.initial_state.InitialState()`,
the file ``BedMachineAntarctica_v2_and_GEBCO_2022_0.05_degree_20220729.nc`` is
slated for later downloaded from
`MPAS-Ocean's bathymetry database <https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/mpas-ocean/bathymetry_database/>`_.
The file will be stored in the subdirectory ``mpas-ocean/bathymetry_database``
of the path in the ``database_root`` config option in the ``paths`` section of
the config file.  The ``database_root`` option is set either by selecting one
of the :ref:`supported_machines` or in the user's config file.

You can also specify the ``database_component`` parameter to choose to get
files from a database belonging to another component, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_input_file(filename='icePresent_QU60km_polar.nc',
                        target='icePresent_QU60km_polar.nc',
                        database='partition',
                        database_component='seaice'

It is also possible to download files directly from a URL and store them in
the step's working directory:

.. code-block:: python

    step.add_input_file(
        filename='dome_varres_grid.nc',
        url='https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/'
            'mpas-albany-landice/dome_varres_grid.nc')

We recommend against this practice except for very small files.

.. _dev_step_input_copy:

Copying input files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In nearly all the cases discussed above, a symlink is created to the input
file, usually either from the ``compass`` package or from one of the databases.
If you wish to copy the file instead of symlinking it (e.g. so a user can make
local modifications), simply add the keyword argument ``copy=True`` to any call
to ``self.add_input_file()``:

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, test_case):
        ...
        self.add_input_file(filename='landice_grid.nc',
                            target='../setup_mesh/landice_grid.nc', copy=True)

In this case, a copy of ``landice_grid.nc`` will be made in the step's work
directory.

.. _dev_step_output:

Output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We require that all steps provide a list of any output files that other steps
are allowed to use as inputs.  This helps us keep track of dependencies and
will be used in the future to enable steps to run in parallel as long as they
don't depend on each other.  Adding an output file is pretty straightforward:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_output_file(filename='output_file.nc')

:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_output_file()` can be called in a step's
:ref:`dev_step_init`: or :ref:`dev_step_setup` method or (less commonly)
in the test case's :ref:`dev_test_case_init`.

The relative path in ``filename`` is with respect to the step's work directory,
and is converted to an absolute path internally before the step is run.

.. _dev_step_cached_output:

Cached output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many ``compass`` test cases and steps are expensive enough that it can become
time consuming to run full workflows to produce meshes and initial conditions
in order to test simulations.  Therefore, ``compass`` provides a mechanism for
caching the outputs of each step in a database so that they can be downloaded
and symlinked rather than being computed each time.

Cached output files are be stored in the ``compass_cache`` database within each
MPAS core's space on that LCRC server (see :ref:`dev_step_input_download`).
If the "cached" version of a step is selected, as we will describe below, each
of the test case's outputs will have a corresponding "input" file added with
the ``target`` being a cache file on the LCRC server and the ``filename`` being
the output file.  ``compass`` uses the ``cached_files.json`` database to know
which cache files correspond to which step outputs.

A developer can indicate that ``compass`` test suite includes steps with cached
outputs in two ways.  First, if all steps in a test case should have cached
output, the following notation should be used:

.. code-block:: none

    ocean/global_ocean/QU240/mesh
        cached
    ocean/global_ocean/QU240/PHC/init
        cached

That is, the word ``cached`` should appear after the test case on its own line.
The indentation is for visual clarity and is not required.


Second, ff only some steps in a test case should have cached output, they need
to be listed explicitly, as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    ocean/global_ocean/QUwISC240/mesh
        cached: mesh
    ocean/global_ocean/QUwISC240/PHC/init
        cached: initial_state ssh_adjustment

The line can be indented for visual clarity, but must begin with ``cached:``,
followed by a list of steps separated by a single space.

Similarly, a user setting up test cases has two mechanisms for specifying which
test cases and steps should have cached outputs.  If all steps in a test case
should have cached outputs, the suffix ``c`` can be added to the test number:

.. code-block:: none

    compass setup -n 90c 91c 92 ...

In this example, test cases 90 and 91 (``mesh`` and ``init`` test cases from
the ``SOwISC12to60`` global ocean mesh, in this case) are set up with cached
outputs in all steps and 92 (``performance_test``) is not.  This approach is
efficient but does not provide any control of which steps use cached outputs
and which do not.

A much more verbose approach is required if some steps use cached outputs and
others do not within a given test case.  Each test case must be set up on its
own with the ``-t`` and ``--cached`` flags as follows:


.. code-block:: none

    compass setup -t ocean/global_ocean/QU240/mesh --cached mesh ...
    compass setup -t ocean/global_ocean/QU240/PHC/init --cached initial_state ...
    ...

Cache files should be generated by first running the test case as normal, then
running the :ref:`dev_compass_cache` command-line tool at the base of the work
directory, providing the names of the steps whose outputs should be added to
the cache.  The resulting ``<mpas_core>_cached_files.json`` should be copied
to ``compass/<mpas_core>/cached_files.json`` in a ``compass`` branch.

Calls to ``compass cache`` must be made on Chrysalis or Anvil.  If outputs were
produced on another machine, they must be transferred to one of these two
machines before calling ``compass cache``.  File can be added manually to the
LCRC server and the ``cached_files.json`` databases but this is not
recommended.

More details on cached outputs are available in the design document
:ref:`design_doc_cached_outputs`.

.. _dev_step_namelists_and_streams:

Adding namelist and streams files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MPAS cores, test groups, and test cases can provide namelist and streams files
that are used to replace default namelist options and streams definitions
before MPAS gets run.  Namelist and streams files within the ``compass``
package must start with the prefix ``namelist.`` and ``streams.``,
respectively, to ensure that they are included when we build the package.

You can make calls to :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()`,
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`  and
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()` as described below to indicate how
name list and streams file should be built up by modifying the defaults for the
MPAS model.  The namelists and streams files themselves are generated
automatically as part of setting up the test case.

.. _dev_step_add_namelists_file:

Adding a namelist file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, a step that runs the MPAS model will include one or more calls to
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()` within the :ref:`dev_step_init`
or :ref:`dev_step_setup` method.  Calling this method simply adds the file to
a list that will be parsed if and when the step gets set up.  (This way, it is
safe to add namelist files to a step in init even if that test case will never
get set up or run.)

The format of the namelist file is simply a list of namelist options and
the replacement values:

.. code-block:: none

    config_write_output_on_startup = .false.
    config_run_duration = '0000_00:15:00'
    config_use_mom_del2 = .true.
    config_implicit_bottom_drag_coeff = 1.0e-2
    config_use_cvmix_background = .true.
    config_cvmix_background_diffusion = 0.0
    config_cvmix_background_viscosity = 1.0e-4

Since all MPAS namelist options must have unique names, we do not worry about
which specific namelist within the file each belongs to.

A typical namelist file is added by passing a package where the namelist file
is located and the name of the input namelist file within that package
as arguments to :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file()`:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_namelist_file('compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel',
                           'namelist.forward')

If the namelist should have a different name than the default
(``namelist.<mpas_core>``), the name can be given via the ``out_name`` keyword
argument.  If ``init`` mode is desired, rather than the default, ``forward``
mode, this can also be specified.

Namelist values are replaced by the files (or options, see below) in the
sequence they are given.  This way, you can add the namelist substitutions for
the test group first, and then override those with the replacements for
the test case or step.

.. _dev_step_add_namelist_options:

Adding namelist options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, it is easier to replace namelist options using a dictionary within
the code, rather than a namelist file.  This is appropriate when there are only
1 or 2 options to replace (so creating a file seems like overkill) or when the
namelist options rely on values that are determined by the code (e.g. different
values for different resolutions).  Simply create a dictionary of replacements
and call :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()` either at init or
in the ``setup()`` method of the step.  These replacements are parsed, along
with replacements from files, in the order they are added.  Thus, you could
add replacements from a namelist file for the test group, test case, or step,
then override them with namelist options in a dictionary for the test case or
step, as in this example:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_namelist_file('compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel',
                           'namelist.forward')
    self.add_namelist_file('compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel',
                           'namelist.{}.forward'.format(step['resolution']))
    if self.nu is not None:
        # update the viscosity to the requested value
        options = {'config_mom_del2': '{}'.format(step['nu'])}
        self.add_namelist_options(options)

Here, we get default options for "forward" steps, then for the resolution of
the test case from namelist files, then update the viscosity ``nu``, which is
an option passed in when creating this step.

.. note::

  Namelist values must be of type ``str``, so use ``'{}'.format(value)`` to
  convert a numerical value to a string.


.. _dev_step_update_namelist_options:

Updating namelist options at runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is sometimes useful to update namelist options after a namelist has already
been generated as part of setting up.  This typically happens within a step's
``run()`` method for options that cannot be known beforehand, particularly
options related to the number of MPI tasks, CPUs per task, and OpenMP threads.
In such cases, call :py:meth:`compass.Step.update_namelist_at_runtime()`:

.. code-block:: python

    ...

    replacements = {'config_pio_num_iotasks': '{}'.format(pio_num_iotasks),
                    'config_pio_stride': '{}'.format(pio_stride)}

    self.update_namelist_at_runtime(options=replacements, out_name=namelist)


.. _dev_step_add_streams_file:

Adding a streams file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Streams files are a bit more complicated than namelist files because
streams files are XML documents, requiring some slightly more sophisticated
parsing.

Typically, a step that runs MPAS will include one or more calls to
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()` within the :ref:`dev_step_init`
or :ref:`dev_step_setup` method.  Calling this function simply adds the file to
a list within the ``step`` dictionary that will be parsed if an when
the step gets set up.  (This way, it is safe to add streams files to a step at
init even if that test case will never get set up or run.)

The format of the streams file is essentially the same as the default and
generated streams file, e.g.:

.. code-block:: xml

    <streams>

    <immutable_stream name="mesh"
                      filename_template="init.nc"/>

    <immutable_stream name="input"
                      filename_template="init.nc"/>

    <immutable_stream name="restart"/>

    <stream name="output"
            type="output"
            filename_template="output.nc"
            output_interval="0000_00:00:01"
            clobber_mode="truncate">

        <var_struct name="tracers"/>
        <var name="xtime"/>
        <var name="normalVelocity"/>
        <var name="layerThickness"/>
    </stream>

    </streams>

These are all streams that are already defined in the default forward streams
for MPAS-Ocean, so the defaults will be updated.  If only the attributes of
a stream are given, the contents of the stream (the ``var``, ``var_struct``
and ``var_array`` tags within the stream) are taken from the defaults.  If
any contents are given, as for the ``output`` stream in the example above, they
replace the default contents.  ``compass`` does not include a way to add or
remove contents from the defaults, just keep the default contents or replace
them all.  (Legacy COMPASS had such an option but it was found to be mostly
confusing and difficult to keep synchronized with the MPAS code.)

A typical streams file is added by calling
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()` with a package where the streams
file is located and the name of the input streams file within that package:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add_streams_file('compass.ocean.tests.baroclinic_channel',
                          'streams.forward')

If the streams file should have a different name than the default
(``streams.<mpas_core>``), the name can be given via the ``out_name`` keyword
argument.   If ``init`` mode is desired, rather than the default, ``forward``
mode, this can also be specified.


.. _dev_step_add_streams_file_template:

Adding a template streams file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main difference between namelists and streams files is that there is no
direct equivalent for streams of :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`.
It is simply too confusing to try to define streams within the code.

Instead, :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()` includes a keyword
argument ``template_replacements``.  If you provide a dictionary of
replacements to this argument, the input streams file will be treated as a
`Jinja2 template <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/>`_ that is rendered
using the provided replacements.  Here is an example of such a template streams
file:

.. code-block:: xml

    <streams>

    <stream name="output"
            output_interval="{{ output_interval }}"/>
    <immutable_stream name="restart"
                      filename_template="../restarts/rst.$Y-$M-$D_$h.$m.$s.nc"
                      output_interval="{{ restart_interval }}"/>

    </streams>

And here is how it would be added, along with replacements:

.. code-block:: python

    stream_replacements = {
        'output_interval': '00-00-01_00:00:00',
        'restart_interval': '00-00-01_00:00:00'}
    add_streams_file(step, module, 'streams.template',
                     template_replacements=stream_replacements)

    ...

    stream_replacements = {
        'output_interval': '00-00-01_00:00:00',
        'restart_interval': '00-00-01_00:00:00'}
    add_streams_file(step, module, 'streams.template',
                     template_replacements=stream_replacements)

In this example, taken from
:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.global_ocean.mesh.qu240.dynamic_adjustement.QU240DynamicAdjustment`,
we are creating a series of steps that will be used to perform dynamic
adjustment of the ocean model, each of which might have different durations and
restart intervals.  Rather than creating a streams file for each step of the
spin up, we reuse the same template with just a few appropriate replacements.
Thus, calls to :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file()` with
``template_replacements`` are qualitatively similar to namelist calls to
:py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options()`.

.. _dev_step_update_streams:

Updating a streams file at runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just as with namelist options, it is sometimes useful to update streams files
after it has already been generated as part of setting up.  This typically
happens within a step's ``run()`` method for properties of the stream that
may be affected by config options that a user may have changed.  In such
cases, call :py:meth:`compass.Step.update_streams_at_runtime()`.  In this
fairly complicated example, the duration of the run in hours is a config option
that we turn into a string.  A dictionary of replacements together with a
template streams file, as described above, are used to update the streams file
with the new run duration:

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    ...

    config = self.config
    # the duration (hours) of the run
    duration = int(3600 * config.getfloat('planar_convergence', 'duration'))
    delta = timedelta(seconds=duration)
    hours = delta.seconds//3600
    minutes = delta.seconds//60 % 60
    seconds = delta.seconds % 60
    duration = f'{delta.days:03d}_{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d}'

    stream_replacements = {'output_interval': duration}

    self.update_streams_at_runtime(
        'compass.ocean.tests.planar_convergence',
        'streams.template', template_replacements=stream_replacements,
        out_name='streams.ocean')


Adding MPAS model as an input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a step involves running MPAS, the model executable can be linked and added
as an input to the step by calling :py:func:`compass.model.add_model_as_input()`
in ``__init__()`` or the ``setup()`` method.  This way, if the user has
forgotten to compile the model, this will be obvious by the broken symlink and
the step will immediately fail because of the missing input.  The path to the
executable is automatically detected based on the work directory for the step
and the config options.

.. _dev_suites:

Test Suites
-----------

As described in the :ref:`test_suites` section of the User's Guide, COMPASS
test cases can be organized into test suites.  Each core has separate regression
suites, and a core can have multiple independent regression suites.  A developer
defines a test suite by creating a `.txt` file within the `compass/CORE/suites`
directory.  The format of the `.txt` file is a list of the work directories to
the tests desired to be part of the suite.  A line starting with `#` will be
treated as a comment line.
