# a list of resolutions (km) to test
resolutions = 16, 8, 4, 2

# number of mesh cells in x and y for 1 km resolution.  Other resolutions have
# the same physical size.  The default is approximately square, because of the
# staggering of the hex mesh.
# The integers used need to be divisible by the ratio of lowest to highest resolutions
nx_1km = 512
ny_1km = 640

# whether to make mesh nonperiodic or not
nonperiodic = False

# the number of cells per core to aim for
goal_cells_per_core = 300

# the approximate maximum number of cells per core (the test will fail if too
# few cores are available)
max_cells_per_core = 3000

# target velocity (m/yr) to be used for defining the timestep
# the actual velocity will be determined by the test case
# This should be slightly larger than the maximum velocity expected
target_velocity = 2000.0

# the duration (years) of the run
duration = 1000
