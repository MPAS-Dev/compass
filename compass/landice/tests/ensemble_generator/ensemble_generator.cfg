# fraction of CFL-limited time step to be used by the adaptive timestepper
# This value is explicitly included here to force the user to consciously
# select the value to use.  Model run time tends to be inversely proportional
# to scaling this value (e.g., 0.2 will be ~4x more expensive than 0.8).
# Value should be less than or equal to 1.0, and values greater than 0.9 are
# not recommended.
# Values of 0.7-0.9 typically work for most simulations, but some runs may
# fail.  Values of 0.2-0.5 are more conservative and will allow more runs
# to succeed, but will result in substantially more expensive runs
# However, because the range of parameter combinations being simulated
# are likely to stress the model, a smaller number than usual may be
# necessary to effectively cover parameter space.
# A user may want to do a few small ensembles with different values
# to inform the choice for a large production ensemble.
