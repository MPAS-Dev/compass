                   ${e3sm_version} with enhanced resolution (${min_res} km) around
                   Antarctica, 45-km resolution in the mid southern latitudes,
                   30-km resolution in a 15-degree band around the equator, 60-km
                   resolution in northern mid latitudes, 30 km in the north
                   Atlantic and 35 km in the Arctic.  This mesh has ${levels}
                   vertical levels and includes cavities under the ice shelves
                   around Antarctica.
