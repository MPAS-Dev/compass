***********************WARNING*****************************
The files_for_e3sm step is a work in progress, and produces
only a subset of the files needed for E3SM support of a new
ocean and sea-ice mesh.
***********************************************************

After running run.py, the directory assembled_files is populated with links.
The directory structure is identical to the E3SM inputdata and diagnostics
directories found here:
https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/

E3SM members should NOT attempt to upload these files.  The files produced here
are only a subset of those needed to support a new mesh in E3SM and should not
be uploaded on their own. E3SM experts who know how to produce the other
coupling files may upload these files along with other required datasets to the
LCRC server.
