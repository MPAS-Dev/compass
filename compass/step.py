class Step:
    """
    The base class for a step of a test cases, such as setting up a mesh,
    creating an initial condition, or running the MPAS core forward in time.
    The step is the smallest unit of work in compass that can be run on its
    own by a user, though users will typically run full test cases or test
    suites.

    Below, the terms "input" and "output" refer to inputs and outputs to the
    step itself, not necessarily the MPAS model.  In fact, the MPAS model
    itself is often an input to the step.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        the name of the test case

    test_case : compass.TestCase
        The test case this step belongs to

    test_group : compass.TestGroup
        The test group the test case belongs to

    mpas_core : compass.MpasCore
        The MPAS core the test group belongs to

    subdir : str
        the subdirectory for the step

    path : str
        the path within the base work directory of the step, made up of
        ``mpas_core``, ``test_group``, the test case's ``subdir`` and the
        step's ``subdir``

    cpus_per_task : int, optional
        the number of cores per task the step would ideally use.  If
        fewer cores per node are available on the system, the step will
        run on all available cores as long as this is not below
        ``min_cpus_per_task``

    min_cpus_per_task : int, optional
        the number of cores per task the step requires.  If the system
        has fewer than this number of cores per node, the step will fail

    ntasks : int, optional
        the number of tasks the step would ideally use.  If too few
        cores are available on the system to accommodate the number of
        tasks and the number of cores per task, the step will run on
        fewer tasks as long as as this is not below ``min_tasks``

    min_tasks : int, optional
        the number of tasks the step requires.  If the system has too
        few cores to accommodate the number of tasks and cores per task,
        the step will fail

    openmp_threads : int
        the number of OpenMP threads to use

    max_memory : int
        the amount of memory that the step is allowed to use in MB.
        This is currently just a placeholder for later use with task
        parallelism

    input_data : list of dict
        a list of dict used to define input files typically to be
        downloaded to a database and/or symlinked in the work directory

    inputs : list of str
        a list of absolute paths of input files produced from ``input_data`` as
        part of setting up the step.  These input files must all exist at run
        time or the step will raise an exception

    outputs : list of str
        a list of absolute paths of output files produced by this step (or
        cached) and available as inputs to other test cases and steps.  These
        files must exist after the test has run or an exception will be raised

    namelist_data : dict
        a dictionary used internally to keep track of updates to the default
        namelist options from calls to
        :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_file`
        and :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_namelist_options`

    streams_data : dict
        a dictionary used internally to keep track of updates to the default
        streams from calls to :py:meth:`compass.Step.add_streams_file`

    config : compass.config.CompassConfigParser
        Configuration options for this test case, a combination of the defaults
        for the machine, core and configuration

    machine_info : mache.MachineInfo
        Information about E3SM supported machines

    config_filename : str
        The local name of the config file that ``config`` has been written to
        during setup and read from during run

    work_dir : str
        The step's work directory, defined during setup as the combination
        of ``base_work_dir`` and ``path``

    base_work_dir : str
        The base work directory

    logger : logging.Logger
        A logger for output from the step

    log_filename : str
        At run time, the name of a log file where output/errors from the step
        are being logged, or ``None`` if output is to stdout/stderr

    cached : bool
        Whether to get all of the outputs for the step from the database of
        cached outputs for this MPAS core

    run_as_subprocess : bool
        Whether to run this step as a subprocess, rather than just running
        it directly from the test case.  It is useful to run a step as a
        subprocess if there is not a good way to redirect output to a log
        file (e.g. if the step calls external code that, in turn, calls
        additional subprocesses).

        work_dir_target : str, optional
            Same as ``target`` but with a path relative to the base work
            directory.  This is useful if it is not easy to determine the
            relative path between the step's work directory and the target.
