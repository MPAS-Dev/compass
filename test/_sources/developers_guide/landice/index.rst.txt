Landice core
============

All test cases in the ``landice`` core share the following set of default
config options:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # This config file has default config options for the landice core

    # The paths section points compass to external paths
    [paths]

    # the relative or absolute path to the root of a branch where MPAS-Ocean
    # has been built
    mpas_model = MPAS-Model/landice/develop

    # The namelists section defines paths to example_compact namelists that will be used
    # to generate specific namelists. By default, these point to the forward and
    # init namelists in the default_inputs directory after a successful build of
    # the landice model.  Change these in a custom config file if you need a different
    # example_compact.
    [namelists]
    forward = ${paths:mpas_model}/default_inputs/namelist.landice

    # The streams section defines paths to example_compact streams files that will be used
    # to generate specific streams files. By default, these point to the forward and
    # init streams files in the default_inputs directory after a successful build of
    # the landice model. Change these in a custom config file if you need a different
    # example_compact.
    [streams]
    forward = ${paths:mpas_model}/default_inputs/streams.landice


    # The executables section defines paths to required executables. These
    # executables are provided for use by specific test cases.  Most tools that
    # compass needs should be in the conda environment, so this is only the path
    # to the MPAS-Ocean executable by default.
    [executables]
    model = ${paths:mpas_model}/landice_model


    # Options related to downloading files
    [download]

    # the path on the server for MALI
    core_path = mpas-albany-landice

The default location for MALI is the `git submodule <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_
at ``MPAS-Model/landice/develop``.  This submodule may not point to the latest
update of the `landice/develop <https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model/tree/landice/develop>`_
branch but the plan is to update the submodule frequently.  The current version
of the submodule should always be guaranteed to be compatible with the
corresponding version of ``compass``.

To make sure the code in the submodule has been cloned and is up-to-date, you
should run

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init --recursive

in the base directory of your local clone of the compass repo.  Then, you can
``cd`` into ``MPAS-Model/landice/develop`` and build the code as appropriate
for whichever of the :ref:`machines` you are using.
