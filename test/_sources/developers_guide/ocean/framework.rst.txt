Ocean framework
===============




  * ``compass.ocean.namelists`` and ``compass.ocean.streams``: namelist
    replacements and streams that are similar to core-level templates in legacy
    COMPASS.  Current templates are for adjusting sea surface height in
    ice-shelf cavities, and outputting variables related to frazil and
    land-ice fluxes,

  * ``compass.ocean.suites``: the ocean test suites

  * ``compass.ocean.vertical``: supports for 1D vertical coordinates and the 3D
    z* coordinate.

  * ``compass.ocean.iceshelf``: computes sea-surface height and
    land-ice pressure, and adjusts them to match one another

  * ``compass.ocean.particles``: initialization of particles

  * ``compass.ocean.plot``: plots initial state and 1D vertical grid
