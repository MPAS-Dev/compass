This test case is set up to create the domains for the MISMIP3D test case, but the
tests themselves must be manually run.

There are two domain sizes:
minimal_width - this is only 3 cells wide laterally, and it useful for long spinups
full_width - this is the full width laterally, and is needed for the perturbation experiments

Running the setup scripts would create the domains for the size selected.  Note the highest
resolutions of the full_width size must be generated manually because they take non-trivial
amounts of time/memory to complete.  Still, the setup script organizes the tools needed, making
this fairly straightforward.

After running the desired resolution Stnd experiment to steady state, setting up and running the
perturbation experiments must be done manually.  See the other README file in this directory
for instructions.
