   dc = 1000.,
! Domain is 800 km wide, standard hex mesh has dx=dc. so nx=800     Double to get both halves.  +2 for stripping off periodicity.  Add a few more to be sure we go past 800 km.
   nx = 1612,
! Half domain is 50 km tall but we are not dealing with reflective boundaries, so our domain is 100 km tall. standard hex mesh has dy=0.866*dc.  So ny=115.473.  But we lose one cell height since the half of the north and south rows are oustide the domain.  Need this number to be odd. Use 117 + 2 for stripping off periodicity +1 for culling to get symmetric mesh.
   ny = 120,
   nVertLevels = 1,
! The mesh will need culling to remove periodicity, so no need to build decomps now.
   nproc = 1
