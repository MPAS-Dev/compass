! MISMIP3D Elmer output uses 2.5 km spacing.
   dc = 10000.,
! Domain is 800 km wide, standard hex mesh has dx=dc. so nx=81.  Double to get both halves.  +2 for stripping off periodicity.  Add a few more to be sure we go past 800 km.
   nx = 169,
! Half domain is 50 km tall but we are not dealing with reflective boundaries, so our domain is 100 km tall. standard hex mesh has dy=0.866*dc.  So ny=11.547.  We want odd number for symmetry in N-S direction, so use 11.  + 2 for stripping off periodicity + 1 for stripping off a non-symmetric cell.
   ny = 14,
   nVertLevels = 1,
! The mesh will need culling to remove periodicity, so no need to build decomps now.
   nproc = 1
