! MISMIP3D Elmer output uses 2.5 km spacing.
   dc = 5000.,
! Domain is 800 km wide, standard hex mesh has dx=dc. so nx=161   Double to get both halves.  +2 for stripping off periodicity.  Add a few more to be sure we go past 800 km.
   nx = 328,
! Half domain is 50 km tall but we are not dealing with reflective boundaries, so our domain is 100 km tall. standard hex mesh has dy=0.866*dc.  So ny=23.09.  We want odd number for symmetry in N-S direction, so use 23.  Use 23  + 2 for stripping off periodicity + 1 for removal to get symmetric mesh.
   ny = 26,
   nVertLevels = 1,
! The mesh will need culling to remove periodicity, so no need to build decomps now.
   nproc = 1
