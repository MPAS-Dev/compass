# COMPASS

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/MPAS-Dev/compass%20testing/_apis/build/status/MPAS-Dev.compass?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/MPAS-Dev/compass%20testing/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

The COMPASS (Configuration Of Model for Prediction Across Scales Setups) 
infrastructure provides a capability for defining simple test-case workflows.
It is intended to house a small number of files which can describe the steps
to setup and configure a test case.

## Documentation

The latest COMPASS documentation can be found here:

[http://mpas-dev.github.io/compass/stable/](http://mpas-dev.github.io/compass/stable/)

The documentation is currently limited to the scripts for listing and setting
up test cases, with extremely limited documentation of the testcases themselves.
We plan to build out the documentation in the coming months.
