After running run.py, the directory assembled_files_for_upload is populated
with links. The directory structure is identical to the E3SM inputdata
directory found here:
https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/inputdata/

The linked  file names are correct and ready for the inputdata repo. To grab
them all, you can use the commands:
   cd assembled_files_for_upload
   tar cvf inputdata.tar inputdata -h
and then copy the tar file to another machine.

E3SM members may add files to the data serves by following instructions here:

The data server path on blues is:
