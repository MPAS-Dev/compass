mismipplus
==========

The ``mismipplus`` test group (:py:class:`compass/landice/tests/mismipplus`)
implements a limited number of the expeirments from the Marine Ice Sheet 
Model Intercomparison Project Plus (MISMIP+; 
`Asay-Davis et al., 2016 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/gmd-9-2471-2016.pdf>`_).
To date, the spinup and ``Ice0`` are the only expeirments currently supported. 
In the future, additional test cases may be added for the missing MISMIP+ 
experiments (i.e. ``Ice1r``, ``Ice1ra``, ``Ice1rr``, ``Ice2r``, ``Ice2r``, ``Ice2ra``, 
``Ice2rr``; Table 2. `Asay-Davis et al., 2016 <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/gmd-9-2471-2016.pdf>`_).

shared config options 
---------------------

Both ``mismipplus`` test cases share the following config options:

.. code-block:: cfg

    [mismipplus]
    
    # the number of cells per core to aim for
    goal_cells_per_core = 300
    
    # the approximate maximum number of cells per core
    max_cells_per_core = 5000
    
The config options are all aimed at dynamically calculating the optimal number 
of ``ntasks`` for the ``run_model`` step based on the resolution requested 
by the test case. For more information about how ``ntasks`` is calculated see 
:ref:`dev_landice_mismipplus_tasks` in the developers guide page.

.. _landice_mismipplus_smoke_test:

smoke_test
----------

``landice/mismipplus/smoke_test`` runs the MISMIP+ ``Ice0`` experiment for 
five years using a spun-up 
`2km mesh <https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/mpas_standalonedata/mpas-albany-landice/MISMIP_2km_20220502.nc>`_.
The simulation is run with the adaptive timestepper on.
There are no configuration options for this test case.
Currently 2000m is the only resolution supported. In the future, the 
``spin_up`` test case will be used to generate new versions of the
mesh at 8000m, 4000m, 2000m, and 1000m resolutions. 

.. _landice_mismipplus_spin_up:

spin_up
-------

``landice/mismipplus/spin_up`` generates the files needed to run a 20,000 year
spin-up using the standard MISMIP+ initial conditions outline in 
`section 2.1 of (Asay-Davis et al., 2016) <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/gmd-9-2471-2016.pdf>`_.
The purpose of this test case is generate a semi-realistic glacier geometry 
that includes an ice shelf, which can be used to the subsequent MISMIP+ 
experiments and/or additional experiments that require 3-D complexity without 
site-specific complications arising from using an actual glacier geometry. 


.. code-block:: cfg

    # config options for the mesh (i.e. initial condition) setup
    [mesh]
    
    # Nominal cell spacing (m). Resolution is "nominal" since the true cell spacing
    # will be determined such that the cell center to cell center length of the
    # entire domain in the y direction is exactly the required y domain length (80 km).
    resolution = 8000.
    
    # length (m) to extend the eastern domain boundary by. Needed for simulations
    # that use a dynamic calving law, where the calving front will be irregularly
    # shaped. Any value less than `2*resolution` will be ignored, as the default
    # gutter length is 2 gridcells.
    gutter_length = 0.
    
    # ice density (kg m^{-3}). MISMIP+ uses 918 (Table 1. Asay-Davis et al. 2016),
    # but MALI defaults to 910. The user can choose if they want to strictly follow
    # MISMIP+ or use the default MALI value.
    ice_density = 918.
    
    # Initial ice thickness (m). The MISMIP+ protocol does not specify an initial
    # ice thickness for the spinup experiment. Therefore the user is allowed to
    # choose their desired value.
    init_thickness = 100.
    
    # Number of vertical levels
    levels = 10
    
    # How to distribute vertical layers. Options are "glimmer" or "uniform".
    # "glimmer" will distribute the layer non-uniformly following
    # Eqn. (15) from Rutt et al. 2009.
    vetical_layer_distribution = glimmer
