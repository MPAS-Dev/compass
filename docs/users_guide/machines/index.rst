Machines
========

One of the major advantages of ``compass`` over :ref:`legacy_compass` is that it
attempts to be aware of the capabilities of the machine it is running on.  This
is a particular advantage for so-called "supported" machines with a config file
defined for them in the ``compass`` package.  But even for "unknown" machines,
it is not difficult to set a few config options in your user config file to
describe your machine.  Then, ``compass`` can use this data to make sure test
cases are configured in a way that is appropriate for your machine.

config options
--------------

The config options typically defined for a machine are:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # The paths section describes paths that are used within the ocean core test
    # cases.
    [paths]

    # A shared root directory where MPAS standalone data can be found
    database_root = /lcrc/group/e3sm/public_html/mpas_standalonedata

    # the path to the base conda environment where compass environments have
    # been created
    compass_envs = /lcrc/soft/climate/compass/chrysalis/base


    # Options related to deploying a compass conda environment on supported
    # machines
    [deploy]

    # the compiler set to use for system libraries and MPAS builds
    compiler = intel

    # the system MPI library to use for intel compiler
    mpi_intel = openmpi

    # the system MPI library to use for gnu compiler
    mpi_gnu = openmpi

    # the base path for spack environments used by compass
    spack = /lcrc/soft/climate/compass/chrysalis/spack

    # whether to use the same modules for hdf5, netcdf-c, netcdf-fortran and
    # pnetcdf as E3SM (spack modules are used otherwise)
    use_e3sm_hdf5_netcdf = True

The ``paths`` section provides local paths to the root of the "databases"
(local caches) of data files for each MPAS core.  These are generally in a
shared location for the project to save space.  Similarly, ``compass_envs``
is a location where shared conda environments will be created for ``compass``
releases for users to share.

The ``deploy`` section is used to help ``compass`` create development and
release conda environments and activation scripts.  It says which compiler set
is the default, which MPI library is the default for each supported compiler,
and where libraries built with system MPI will be placed.

Some config options come from a package, `mache <https://github.com/E3SM-Project/mache/>`_
that is a dependency of ``compass``.  ``mache`` is designed to detect and
provide a machine-specific configuration for E3SM supported machines.  Typical
config options provided by ``mache`` that are relevant to ``compass`` are:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # The parallel section describes options related to running jobs in parallel
    [parallel]

    # parallel system of execution: slurm, cobalt or single_node
    system = slurm

    # whether to use mpirun or srun to run a task
    parallel_executable = srun

    # cores per node on the machine
    cores_per_node = 36

    # account for running diagnostics jobs
    account = e3sm

    # quality of service (default is the first)
    qos = regular, interactive


The ``parallel`` section defined properties of the machine, to do with parallel
runs. Currently, machine files are defined for high-performance computing (HPC)
machines with multiple nodes.  These machines all use :ref:`slurm` to submit
parallel jobs.  They also all use the ``srun`` command to run individual
tasks within a job.  The number of ``cores_per_node`` vary between machines,
as does the account that typical ``compass`` users will have access to on the
machine.

.. _slurm:

Slurm job queueing
------------------

Most HPC systems now use the
`slurm workload manager <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_.
Here are some basic commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    salloc -N 1 -t 2:0:0 # interactive job (see machine specific versions below)
    sbatch script # submit a script
    squeue # show all jobs
    squeue -u <my_username> # show only your jobs
    scancel jobID # cancel a job

.. _supported_machines:

Supported Machines
------------------

On each supported machine, users will be able to source a script to activate
the appropriate compass environment and compilers.  Most machines support 2
compilers, each with one or more variants of MPI and the required NetCDF,
pNetCDF and SCORPIO libraries.  These scripts will first load the conda
environment for ``compass``, then it will load modules and set environment
variables that will allow you to build and run the MPAS model.

A table with the full list of supported machines, compilers, MPI variants,
and MPAS-model build commands is found in :ref:`dev_supported_machines` in
the Developer's Guide.  In the links below, we list only the commands needed
to use the default MPI variant for each compiler on each machine.

.. _other_machines:

Other Machines
--------------

If you are working on an "unknown" machine, you will need to define some of
the config options that would normally be in a machine's config file yourself
in your user config file:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # This file contains some common config options you might want to set

    # The paths section describes paths to databases and shared compass environments
    [paths]

    # A root directory where MPAS standalone data can be found
    database_root = /home/xylar/data/mpas/mpas_standalonedata

    # The parallel section describes options related to running tests in parallel
    [parallel]

    # parallel system of execution: slurm or single_node
    system = single_node

    # whether to use mpirun or srun to run the model
    parallel_executable = mpirun -host localhost

    # cores per node on the machine, detected automatically by default
    # cores_per_node = 4

The paths for the MPAS core "databases" can be any emtpy path to begin with.
If the path doesn't exist, ``compass`` will create it.

If you're not working on an HPC machine, you will probably not have multiple
nodes or :ref:`slurm`.  You will probably install
`MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/>`_ or `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_,
probably via a
`conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_.
In this case, the ``parallel_executable`` is ``mpirun``.

To install the `compass` package into a conda environment, you will first need
to install `Miniconda3 <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ (if
miniconda is not already installed), then add the
`conda-forge channel <https://conda-forge.org/#about>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict


Then, you will run one of the following three commands, depending on how you
would like to handle MPI support in the conda packages.

MPICH
-----

To create a conda environment called "compass" with MPI from the ``mpich``
package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n compass -c conda-forge -c e3sm/label/compass python=3.9 "compass=*=mpi_mpich*"

This is the recommended default for single-node Linux and OSX machines.

OpenMPI
-------

To create a conda environment called "compass" with MPI from the ``openmpi``
package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n compass -c conda-forge -c e3sm/label/compass python=3.9 "compass=*=mpi_openmpi*"

No MPI from conda-forge
-----------------------

To create a conda environment called "compass" without any MPI package from
conda-forge, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n compass -c conda-forge -c e3sm/label/compass python=3.9 "compass=*=nompi*"

This would be the starting point for working with ``compass`` on an unknown
HPC machine.  From there, you would also need to load modules and set
environment variables so that MPAS components can be built with system NetCDF,
pNetCDF and SCORPIO. This will likely require working with an MPAS developer.
