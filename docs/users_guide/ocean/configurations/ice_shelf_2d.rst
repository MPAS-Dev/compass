ice_shelf_2d
============

The ``ocean/ice_shelf_2d`` configuration describes a
series of very simplified ice-shelf test cases where topography and initial
conditions only vary in the y direction.  The test case currently supports
only 5-km horizontal resolution and 20 vertical levels, each 50 m thick.
The x direction is periodic and only 10 cells wide, whereas the y direction has
solid boundaries and is 44 cells long.  The Coriolis parameter :math:`f` is
zero.  This makes the test case quasi-two-dimensional, with negligible
variability in x.

The initial temperature for the whole domain is constant (1 degree Celsius),
while salinity varies linearly with depth from 34.5 PSU at the sea surface
to 34.7 PSU at the sea floor, which is at a constant at 2000 m depth.  The
conceptual overlying ice shelf depresses the sea surface height buy as much as
1990 m (leaving a 10-m water column) for the first 30 km in y.  Over the next
30 km, it rises to 1490 m, then fairly abruptly to zero over the next 15 km,
where it remains for the second half of the domain.  The ice shelf occupies
these first 75 km of the domain: fluxes from ice-shelf melting are only applied
in this region.

The geometry does not represent a particularly realistic ice-shelf cavity but
it is a quick and useful test of the parameterization of land-ice melt fluxes
and of frazil formation below ice shelves.

Both of the ``ice_shelf_2d`` test cases are composed of 3 types of steps:
``initial_state``, which defines the mesh and initial conditions for the model;
``ssh_adjustment``, which modifies the ``landIcePressure`` field (the pressure
from the overlying ice shelf) so it is in dynamic balance with the ``ssh``
(sea-surface height) field that also corresponds to the ice draft under the
ice shelf; and ``forward``, which performs time integration of the model.

shared config options
---------------------

Both ``ice_shelf_2d`` test cases share the following config options:

.. code-block:: cfg

    # Options related to the vertical grid
    [vertical_grid]

    # the type of vertical grid
    grid_type = uniform

    # Number of vertical levels
    vert_levels = 20

    # Depth of the bottom of the ocean
    bottom_depth = 2000.0


    # namelist options for 2D ice-shelf testcases
    [ice_shelf_2d]

    # Vertical thickness of ocean sub-ice cavity
    cavity_thickness = 10.0

    # Vertical thickness of fixed slope
    slope_height = 500.0

    # Horizontal width of angled part of the ice
    edge_width = 15.0e3

    # cavity edge in y
    y1 = 30.0e3

    # shelf edge in y
    y2 = 60.0e3

    # Temperature of the surface in the northern half of the domain
    temperature = 1.0

    # Salinity of the water in the entire domain
    surface_salinity = 34.5

    # Salinity of the water in the entire domain
    bottom_salinity = 34.7

    ## the following are set manually within the test case
    # number of mesh cells in x
    nx = 10

    # number of mesh cells in y
    ny = 44

    # size of grid cells in meters
    dc = 5e3

You can modify the horizontal mesh, vertical grid, geometry, and initial
temperature and salinity of the test case by altering these options.


default
-------

``ocean/ice_shelf_2d/5km/default`` includes a relatively
strenuous, iterative process to dynamically adjust ``landIcePressure`` and
``ssh`` to be compatible with one another in the ``ssh_adjustment`` step.
In this test case, we perform 15 iterations of adjustment, enough that changes
in pressure should be quite small compared to those in the first iteration.
Reducing this number will make the test case run more quickly at the risk of
having longer-lived transients at the beginning of the simulation.

.. code-block:: cfg

    # Options relate to adjusting the sea-surface height or land-ice pressure
    # below ice shelves to they are dynamically consistent with one another
    [ssh_adjustment]

    # the number of iterations of ssh adjustment to perform
    iterations = 15

By default, the ``forward`` step runs for 10 minutes (2 time steps).  Then, if a baseline
run of the test case was provided for comparison, we perform validation of both
the prognostic variables (layer thickness, velocity, temperature and salinity)
and a large number of variables associated with freshwater and heat fluxes
under ice shelves.

Frazil-ice formation is not included in this test case.

restart_test
------------

``ocean/ice_shelf_2d/5km/restart_test`` performs fewer
iterations of ``ssh_adjustment`` than ``default``, but it does include
frazil-ice formation.  The model is integrated forward in time for a 2 time
steps (10 min) in the ``full_run`` step, saving a restart file every 5 minutes.
Then, a second ``restart_run`` step is performed from the restart file 5
minutes into the simulation.  Prognostic variables, variables related to
sub-ice-shelf fluxes, and variables related to frazil formation are compared
between the "full" and "restart" runs at minute 10 of the simulation to
make sure they are bit-for-bit identical.

.. code-block:: cfg

    # Options relate to adjusting the sea-surface height or land-ice pressure
    # below ice shelves to they are dynamically consistent with one another
    [ssh_adjustment]

    # the number of iterations of ssh adjustment to perform
    iterations = 2
