.. _dev_ocean_soma:

soma
====

The ``soma`` test group (:py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.soma.Soma`)
implements variants of the  Simulating Ocean Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) test
case (see :ref:`ocean_soma`) at resolutions between 4 and 32 km. Here, we
describe the shared framework for this test group and the 5 types of test cases
currently supported: ``default``, ``long``, ``particles``,
``surface_restoring``, and ``three_layer``.

.. _dev_ocean_soma_framework:

framework
---------

The shared config options for the ``soma`` test group are described
in :ref:`ocean_soma` in the User's Guide.

Additionally, the test group has several shared namelist and streams files,
some for shared parameters and streams for creating the initial condition
(``namelist.init`` and ``streams.init``), some for forward runs
(``namelist.forward`` and ``streams.forward``) and some related to enabling
analysis members in a run and outputting their results (``namelist.analysis``
and ``streams.analysis``).

initial_state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The class :py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.soma.initial_state.InitialState`
defines a step for setting up the initial state for each test case.

First, a mesh appropriate for the resolution is downloaded from the MPAS-Ocean
mesh database.  Then, the mesh is culled to remove "land" cells beyond the
1,500 km basin radius.  MPAS-Ocean is then run in ``init`` mode to generate
the vertical grid, with 100 non-uniform layers according to the
``100layerE3SMv1`` distribution, and to compute initial temperature and
salinity fields.  A constant wind forcing is also generated.

forward
~~~~~~~

The class :py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.soma.forward.Forward` defines a step
for running MPAS-Ocean from the initial condition produced in the
``initial_state`` step.  Namelist and streams files are generated when the test
case is set up (combining the ``*.forward`` and ``*.analysis`` files from the
test group) and updated at runtime based on the config options in the
``[soma]`` section of the config file.

:ref:`dev_ocean_framework_particles` are included in ``32km`` simulations.  In
order to partition the particles, we need to first generate the required graph
partition, then partition the particles, and finally run MPAS-Ocean (including
updating PIO namelist options):

.. code-block:: python

    cores = self.cores
    partition(cores, self.config, self.logger)
    if self.with_particles:
        section = self.config['soma']
        min_den = section.getfloat('min_particle_density')
        max_den = section.getfloat('max_particle_density')
        nsurf = section.getint('surface_count')
        build_particle_simple(
            f_grid='mesh.nc', f_name='particles.nc',
            f_decomp='graph.info.part.{}'.format(cores),
            buoySurf=np.linspace(min_den, max_den, nsurf))
    run_model(self, partition_graph=False)

.. _dev_ocean_soma_default:

analysis
~~~~~~~~

The class :py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.soma.analysis.Analysis`
defines a step for analyzing the results of a forward run with particles
and plotting the particle temperature and salinity against the initial T and S
profiles.

soma_test_case
--------------

The :py:class:`compass.ocean.tests.soma.soma_test_case.SomaTestCase` class
defined all the SOMA test cases. If a baseline is provided when calling
:ref:`dev_compass_setup`, the test case ensures that the final values of
``temperature`` and ``layerThickness`` are identical to the baseline values.
If particles are included, a number of particle-related variables and timers
are also validated against the baseline.
